# turing-machine
Turing machine simulator written in Javascript as a solution to the [question #10](https://osprogramadores.com/desafios/d10/) from the website [Os Programadores](https://osprogramadores.com/).

To run the project you are going to need NodeJS installed on your machine.


## Download and extract the data files

From the root directory of the project run the command below

```
mkdir data
wget -qO- https://osprogramadores.com/files/d10/turing.tar.gz | tar xvz -C ./data
```
or just download the [files](https://osprogramadores.com/files/d10/turing.tar.gz) and extract by yourself inside data directory


## Run the project with datafile as arg

```
node index.js datafile
```
