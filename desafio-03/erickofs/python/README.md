# Palindrome Calculator

This Python program utilizes the `PalCalc` class from the `palcalc` module to calculate and display palindromes within a given range.

## Running the Program

You need to install Python on your machine (3.10+). After you have installed Python, you can run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
python __main__.py
```
The program will prompt you to enter the first and the last number to do the calculation. If you set "" for both, calculation will be through 0 to 100.

The main program imports the `PalCalc` class and uses it to calculate and then prints the list of palindromes within that range.
