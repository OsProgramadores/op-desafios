# Palindromes

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar.

## How it works

Take all the numbers between a range, transform them into a string, reverse them and compare the result between the original string and the reversed string, if they remain identical, it is a palindrome.

## Use

```bash
python palindrome.py [START] [STOP]
```

 `(Optional)` Make sure the file can be executed: `chmod +x palindrome.py`

```bash
./palindrome.py [START] [START]
```

For testing purposes, default `start` and `stop` values ​​were defined and optionally custom values ​​could be passed through the arguments.
